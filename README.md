# SIFT-Based-Image-Analysis-and-Comparison-Tool
Developing a Python program using OpenCV to extract and visualize SIFT-based keypoints from images and compare multiple images using a Bag-of-Words model built from SIFT descriptors.

This program can take one or multiple image files as input.
```bash
python siftImages.py imagefile1 [imagefile2 imagefile3 imagefile4 ...]
```
